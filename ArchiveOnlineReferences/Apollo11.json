Each frame has been converted to a common scale and has been deconvolved and enhanced. The WMV film begins with a presentation of the frames in the order which they were taken. The next section presents the frames in order of solar elevation, beginning with local sunrise and ending with sunset. The third sequence is ordered by solar elevation and shows as area of about 600 x 360 meters, centered on the LM. The sequence shows changes in the appearance of the LM, terrain features, astronaut tracks, rocks, and deployed equipment under different lighting conditions. The sequence also shows bright objects well away from the LM which, because each persists over two or more consecutive images, are almost certainly pieces of Mylar blown off the descent stage during LM liftoff. The final sequence, GoneToPlaid writes, \"is a repeat of the previous sequence, but with only a one-sixth-second delay before transitioning to the next image. This helps the sequence flow smoothly from start to finish. It also provides a stronger visual effect where the viewer can clearly see the top of the LM descent stage shifting left and right, relative to the footpads, due to the changing perspective from which the LRO viewed the AP11 landing site.\""},{"HtmlTitle":"M102000149R","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11LROC090712first.tiff","ImageSizeBytes":2800000,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"A detail enlarged by a factor of three shows the LRRR and PSEP as bright spots roughly 21 and 27 meters, respectively, south of the LM.

A labeled version shows both Cat's Paw and West Crater. Eagle landed just west of West Crater in an area which, in this Kaguya image, is relatively bright. High-resolution photographs of the Apollo 15, Apollo 16, and Apollo 17 landing sites taken with the Pan Camera flown in the Service Module's Sim Bay on each of those missions show a bright area around each of the LMs, with the lighter albedo probably due to sweeping of the surface by the descent engine.

Scan courtesy Bob Craddock and Allan Needell, National Air and Space Museum. \r\nThe landing ellipse is centered at map coordinates L.0/14.0 and extends north and south 2.4 km from that point and 9.4 km east and west. Mike Collins marked a number of locations with combinations of lines, arrows, circles, and one ellipse using either pencil or a felt-tipped pen. Most of these are associated with estimated LM locations that were given to him at various times during his solo operations in lunar orbit.\r\nBeginning at the upper left, there is a penciled ellipse labeled 'Auto Optics' and including craters at N.7/7.2 and M.0/6.7 that Mike mentions at 106:43:08. Owen Garriott gave Mike settings for Auto Optics operation of the sextant at 105:19:59; and, at 106:11:49, about 35 minutes before Mike's next pass over the landing site, Bruce McCandless told him \"We'd like you to let the Auto optics take care of the tracking and devote your energies to trying to pick out the LM (visually) on the lunar surface.\"\r\nThe 'Auto Optics' ellipse also contains a small circle at L.7/6.6 and attached arrow from the southwest drawn with a felt-tipped pen. I have not been able to associate this circle with anything in the transcript or in Figure 5-14 (below) from the Apollo 11 Mission Report.\r\nImmediately to the right of the upper end of the 'Auto Optics' ellipse, Mike has drawn circle, probably around the 'tiny crater' at M.7/8.0 that he mentions at 104:42:48.\r\nBelow the 'Auto Optics' ellipse, a penciled arrow leads to a circle drawn at K.8/6.3. At 112:22:20, Mike requested an estimated LM position for his pass over the landing site at 112:31:52. Bruce McCandless gave him K.9/6.3 and, as can be seen in Figure 5-14 (below), the actual landing site is just outside the sextant field-of-view for this location.\r\nBelow and to the right, an arrow drawn with a felt-tipped pen and labeled 'Last Bst Pos Prior L/O' leads to a dark spot at J.5/7.7, which is the estimated location Ron Evans gave Mike at 123:55:23, about a half hour before LM lift off. This location is only about 230 meters from the actual landing site at J.65/7.52. Farther down the map, Mike circled craters at E.3/7.6 and E.8/7.7 and to the left of the E.3/7.6 crater wrote 'SW Rim'. These two craters are in the area he examined during the pass over the landing site at 110:33:40 using the sextant in automatic mode and a set of coordinates Bruce McCandless gave him at 110:18:39. Mike reported the negative results at 110:36:58 but mentioned a \"suspiciously-small, white object\" on the southwest rim of the E.3/7.6 crater.\r\nFinally, there is a small, blue dot at about K.2/5.6, which may not have been purposefully drawn."},{"HtmlTitle":"a11mrf514","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf5-14.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":1600000,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11mrf5-14-sm.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":400000,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"This is figure 5-14 from the Apollo 11 Mission Report and shows the various estimates of the landing location given to MIke Collins while Armstrong and Aldrin were on the surface.

Mike Gentry at NASA Johnson gives a date for the photo of 9 July 1969, but this may represent the date when the photo was released to the public and that the date it was taken was earlier. Research by Frederic Artner. \r\nThe suit is shown with a strap-on pocket attached to the left thigh, as was the case during the EVA. In a detail from S69-38889 ( 166k ), we see some horizontal strips of Velcro hooks on the outside of the top flap which, on later missions, mated with horizontal strips of Velcro pile on the suit to hold the flap open. In the detail, we see that a loop of Velcro has been added been attached to the flap and a corresponding strip of Velcro has been attached over the front of the left hip. Further details of a typical strap-on pocket can be found in an Apollo 16 discussion. The suit shown in that discussion is Charlie Duke's training suit, which had horizontal strips of Velcro pile just above the knee, because Charlie wore his strap-on pockets on his shins.\r\nUlli Lotzmann notes that the card placed between the boots that reads \"PGA 076\" is wrong. The actual serial number of Neil's PGA is 056. The mistake is undoubtedly due to the fact that the serial number of Neil's suit 'liner assembly' is 076. The person who created the card probably saw the serial number of the liner and thought that was the number for the entire PGA as well. Bill Ayrey (ILC) has provided \"the fit-check record from the day that Neil was initially fitted into his 056 suit. It was on December 5, 1968 at 5 PM (which was on a Thursday). Mel Case was the ILC engineer performing the fit check. Neil came back to ILC on Saturday, May 3, 1969 for his final fit-check in the 056 suit.\"\r\nJournal Contributor Roland Suhr notes that there isn't a mission patch on the suit. Photos S69-38489 to 38517, taken during an EMU Crew and Cabin Fit-and-Function (CCFF) session on 25 June 1969, also show the flight suits without mission patches. Clearly, the patches were put on the suits no earlier than 25 June. On 27 January 2014, ILC Historian Bill Ayrey wrote: \"ILC was responsible for preparing the suits which included sewing the patches on. NASA was responsible for providing the patches which as I recall, they bought from a company named Lion Brothers. (Bill is correct. See Gene Dorr's patch webpage.) Ron Woods was one of our ILC suit technicians at the time and actually suited Buzz up for his Apollo 11 mission. \" On 28 January 2014, Ron Woods told Ayrey \"We were very late on sewing on the Beta (cloth) Flight Patches. Maybe two weeks prior to launch. And, of course, they were top stitched with the sewing machine and then carefully hand sewn through the top layer of the TMG (Thermal-Micrometeoroid Garment).\""},{"HtmlTitle":"NEILGLV2","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/NEILGLV2.JPG","ImageSizeBytes":27648,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"This pre-flight photo shows Neil's EVA (extra-vehicular) gloves.

The top was painted with a special white paint to minimize solar absorption and to maximize radiation. In contrast, the bottom was highly reflective to minimize absorption of heat reflected from the lunar surface. The handle/camera interface was designed with two trunnions and two 'hooks' and a latching mechanism so that, as you rotated the handle to its operating position, the handle was latched to the camera.

Note that, although the astronauts have removed their helmets, they are still using their Portable Oxygen Ventilators to provide air circulation and cooling. Note that the units attached to the suits have white hoses while the unit on the left has black hoses. Perhaps because each unit could only provide oxygen for a limited amount of time, at least two sets of units were used sequentially from the time that the crew started breathing pure oxygen in the suiting room until they were hooked up to spacecraft oxygen. Journal Contributor James Hill calls attention to the fact that, as can be seen in launch-day photo 69-H-1121, units with white hoses were in use as they boarded the transfer van for the trip to the pad and, as can be seen in launch-day photo KSC-69PC-399, by the time they were on the swing arm, they were using black-hose units. In a May 2007 exchange of e-mail, Apollo suit tech Troy Stewart indicated that the black hoses were probably the same as the white hoses except that the outer, thermal insulation had been removed. We do not currently know if there was a thermal reason for using two different units or if the units could provide oxygen for less than the hour that the crews typically used the POVs and the difference in the hoses was a means of keeping track of the units.

It simply monitored the level through a capacitance probe and added LH as the LH evaporated following the filling by the Propellants section and through pressurization, after which there was no boil off. Our section was an Elec section working alongside the Mechs who managed the tank farms and overall propellant handling.

Taken by Buzz out the CDR window, with the RCS quad in the lower left corner. When this picture was taken, Neil and Buzz were in the midst of LM Activation. Markus Mehring has produced a richly-labeled version ( 0.3 Mb ). See, also, Figure 1-20a ( 0.8 Mb or 0.1 Mb ) in the Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report. Scan courtesy NASA Johnson.\r\nLanding Site 2 is located just right of center at the very edge of the terminator. Crater Maskelyne is the large one at the lower right, with Maskelyne B directly beyond. Hypatia Rille (U.S. Highway Number One) is at upper left, with the crater Moltke just to the right (north) of it. Sidewinder Rille and Diamondback Rille extend from left to right across the center of the picture. Maskelyne and Maskelyne B have a diameter of almost 24 and 9 km respectively, and the distance from the crater center of Maskelyne to the Apollo 11 landing site is about 210 km. While Moltke is a relatively small crater, with a diameter of merely 6.5 km, its very light ejecta blanket makes it easy to find for Earth-based observers with moderately sized telescopes, making it a popular landmark for locating Station Tranquillitatis. Research by Danny Caes. Compare with a Starry Night view ( 0.2Mb ) of the area at the same time 5437 was taken.\r\nWhen I wrote a version of this caption sometime between 2 October 2008 and 27 April 2009, I thought this image was taken at about 94:50:00, when Buzz told Houston, \":Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11. We just had a very good view of the landing site. We can pick out most all of the features we've identified previously.\":. I didn't start using JPL Horizons until September 2009 and, until July 2012, hadn't checked the solar elevation at Tranquility Base at 94:50:00. It was 6.6 degrees, much too high to have put the terminator in its 5437 location. During my re-evaluation of this sequence of photos, I looked through the on-board transcripts recently added to the Apollo 11 Flight Journal for Day 4, including time Neil and Buzz spent in Eagle. At 82:56:25, Buzz tells Neil and Mike, \"I think I can see it, for sure. Yes, I got it beautiful - I can - I got the whole landing site here.\" At this time, the solar elevation at Tranquility is only 0.6 degrees, which would put the terminator about 0.6 degrees of longitude west of the landing site. In the labeled version of 5437 we see that the terminator is at about the location of Crater Sabine C which is, indeed, 0.6 degrees west of Tranquility Base."},{"HtmlTitle":"5438","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-37-5438.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":131072,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-37-5438HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":1755136,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Oblique view a bit east of north as they cross the terminator on Rev 4.

Impressions in the lunar soil made by the lunar boots of the two astronauts are clearly visible.\r\nJournal Contributor AwE130 has provided an enhanced detail which shows the Contingency Sample Collector (CSC) ring, which had been previously identified in EVA photo AS11-40-5864 by the Eric Jones. In the 5505 detail, we see a light-colored \"\"stem\" on the outside of the ring which, as is suggested by the comparison with pre-flight photo S68-54939, fit in the Sampler handle to secure the ring in place. Journal Contributor Karl Dodenhoff has provided a photo of a CSC on display at the Kennedy Space Center. The base of the stem is marked. See also, procedures for CSC use from the Apollo 11 Final Lunar Surface Procedures volume, in which we learn that the \"ring\" was part of the \"lip/bag assembly\". AwE130 notes that the ring can also be seen in post-EVA photos AS11-39-5798-5800 and in EVA photo AS11-40-5871.\r\nNote that, because this image was taken out Neil's window, we now realize that that the ring flew a few meters from the spot near the MESA, on the other side of the spacecraft, where we see Neil tossing the ring in 16-mm film shot out Buzz's window.

The two craters close together in the middle distance are Messier and Messier A, with light-colored rays extending westward from Messier A, the more distant of the two. Apollo 11 photo AS11-42-6304 shows the pair from overhead. Taruntius P is partially hidden behind the RCS thruster. Taruntius K is the slightly smaller crater further north. Taruntius H is the prominent crater west of K. These crater look relatively fresh. Taruntius K has a diameter of about 6 kilometers and has a raised rim. Section 4.1.1 in the Lunar Source Book indicates that a fresh crater of this size will have a depth (iincluding the rim) of about 1.2 km. The average inner slope is, then, about 22 degrees. The crater is undoubtedly bowl shaped, so the slope immediately inside the rim is considerably steeper than 22 degrees. During the Rev 4 pass over the foreground craters, the Sun's elevation was about 29 degrees, low enough to have produced a significant shadow inside the eastern rim but not reaching the center of the crater. The only other time prior to the landing when the crew would have had time to take this picture was on the Rev 5 pass. The Sun was a degree higher on that pass, still low enough to produce the inner shadow."},{"HtmlTitle":"5847","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5847HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":851968,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5847.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":163840,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"View out Neil's window after the landing.

Buzz is standing flat-footed next to the SWC, facing Neil, who is at about the 2 o'clock position out from the LM. In the lower right corner, notice the scratch marks that the TV cable made as Neil pulled it out. The multiple tracks were made by the individual cable loops scraping along the ground. We can see underneath the engine bell. Most of the surface in this image has not been disturbed as yet, and in the places where Neil and Buzz have walked, the disturbed surface is darker. Good illustration of this very common phenomenon. Jack Schmitt speculates that the Descent Engine plume swept away the smallest particles, leaving a higher than normal percentage of larger particles. The more jagged surface is a better reflector of sunlight than the normal surface and, therefore, appears brighter. Certainly, from orbit, the areas around the landed LM's are brighter than the normal surface. As they walk around, the astronauts disturb this modified surface and, in effect, restore it's normal condition. We see the MESA, in shadow, to the right of Buzz. On the front of Buzz's suit, we have the RCU, the camera bracket, and just above his crotch, the \"Red Apple\" activator for the purge valve. He has some dirt on his knees.

In 5874 Buzz is facing the flag and saluting; but, by the time Neil takes 5875, Buzz has turned his body slightly - and his head a great deal more - to look over to see if Neil has taken the picture, possibly having lowered his right hand in the interim. Normally, the high reflectivity of the gold visor would keep us from seeing Buzz's face but, as Mehring notes, in this case \"his face is directly illuminated by the sunlight from the front and at a right angle to the observer's point of view, so it literally shines through the visor, especially because he's sticking his head forward. At different viewing and illumination angles and with his head deeper inside the helmet and less brightly illuminated, reflections off of the visor that would wash out anything behind it. But in this case we're lucky.\" Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek has created a two-frame movie consisting of frames 5874 and 5875 which clearly shows Buzz turning his torso slightly between frames, but without moving his feet.

Ulli Lotzmann has captured a frame from the 16mm film showing Neil as he takes 5903. No other Apollo photograph has been reproduced as often as this portrait of Buzz. Neil is, of course, visible in reflection on Buzz's visor. Buzz has his left arm raised and is probably reading the checklist sewn on the wrist cover of his glove, which is shown in a detail. He is moving his right foot forward, as can be seen by the mound of dirt building up in front of the toe of that boot. Note the dirt adhering to Buzz's boots and knees. Otherwise, he is remarkably clean. The \"Red Apple\", which he would grab and pull to open his purge valve in the event of a suit leak or a PLSS failure, is located roughly over his navel. From our perspective, the purge valve is installed in the connector to the left of the \"Red Apple\". \r\nMany readers will note that the scan from original film looks different from the presentation of 5903 that the world has been seeing since the image was released soon after Neil, Mike, and Buzz returned from the Moon. See a history of the image linked here.\r\nJournal Contributor Markus Mehring has produced a rectified close-up of Neil's reflection in Buzz's visor. \"I scanned the best and largest print I had available, removed the roughly 5 degree tilt that the original has in relation to the horizon, mirrored it, adjusted color in order to somewhat get rid of the golden tint of the visor, and re-projected it flat in order to kill as much spherical appearance as tolerable - hence the smear on the edges, which is impossible to avoid.\"\r\nIn March 2005, Journal Contributor Eric Nelson digitally removed the gold color of Buzz's visor ( 321k ) and revealed an unmistakably blue reflection of Earth. Nelson writes, \" I eliminated most all of the gold visor tint, leaving a spot that wasn't white and so suggested itself as a film artifact rather than a piece of dust. On scanned slide film, dust would be black anyway, unless it might be some small translucent particle. I get the feeling the AS-11 master film scanning was done with some attention to cleanliness though, which should exclude any foreign objects of that size on the image. It is possible to verify whether any wanted or unwanted tint remains in neutrals in an image by temporarily saturating them heavily; I did that to the Spot toward 100% increase, and it turned Earth-Blue. I similarly saturated the gold-subtracted lunar surface reflections, and the open sunlit surface remained neutral while the surface in the influence of reflection from the LM turned gold: this suggests the gold subtraction was accurate and revealed a valid neutral image. This suggests the gold-subtracted spot did have a blue component...and I hope I don't take too much artistic license in exaggerating it to produce a psycho-visual link!\"\r\nKipp Teague writes \"I returned to the original June 2004 JSC scan of AS11-40-5903, cropped to Aldrin's visor, flipped and slightly rotated the image and took a stab at adjusting color to offset the gold in the visor. The linked image ( 109k ) represents the original scanning resolution. I don't see a BRIGHT blue object in the sky, but indeed, whatever is there is bluish in color, and more importantly, it is NOT single-pixel scanner noise as I can see elsewhere in the scan. Even better, when you enlarge this, you can see that the object generally matches in shape the Earth as viewed over the LM in AS11-40-5924.\"\r\nIn addition to investigations of the intrinsic characteristics of the Spot, it is necessary to verify that geometric factors are all correct. A check of JPL Horizons shows that, at 0414 UT on 21 July 1969, Earth was 59.07 degrees above the western Tranquility horizon at an azimuth of 273.11. The Sun was 14.74 degrees above eastern horizon at an azimuth of about 88.84 degrees. The fact that the azimuth difference between the Earth and the Sun was close to 180 degrees, an image of Earth, if any, would be near the line of Buzz's shadow. Further, because the Earth was about 60 degrees above the western horizon, its reflection would appear at a place on the visor where a line perpendicular to the visor surface is 30 degrees (half the Earth's elevation) above horizontal. A labeled detail from AS11-40-5875 ( 74k ) shows that this condition is met near the top of the visor.\r\nSharp-eyed readers will have noticed that the analysis is not yet complete. With Earth slightly north of west and the Sun lightly north of east, the reflected image of Earth should be on the opposite side of the reflected image of Buzz's shadow from the reflected LM. Nelson has produced a rectified detail ( 192k ) in which \"I re-projected the visor image to flatten the horizon (effectively killing barrel distortion), rotated the horizon to level, and then horizontally skewed the image to parallel and square-to-vertical the LM descent stage sides. Finally I mirrored it to produce a normal view to the west. Some distortions remain, which suggests the visor isn't spherical, so that could explain sundry slight geometric inconsistencies in the rough analysis.\". The rectified image shows the tentative Earth 'image' tantalizingly close to the line of Buzz's shadow, but on the wrong side. It is tempting to think that consideration of the actual figure of the gold visor will move the 'image' to the other side of the line of Buzz's shadow, but the necessary analysis is yet to be done."},{"HtmlTitle":"5904","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5904.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":68608,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"110:43:33 Unintended photo of one of the suits, probably taken when Buzz got the camera either from Neil or off the MESA."},{"HtmlTitle":"5905","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5905HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":1130496,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/AS11-40-5905.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":230400,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"110:43:33 This photo was taken from the north of the LM.

From the site map detail we see that, from the south rim of Little West Crater, the north rim of West Crater is about 460 meters away on an azimuth of about 92.7 degrees. With the help of a little trigonometry, this information gives an azimuth of the north rim of West Crater from Neil's location of 92.4 degrees, with the south rim azimuth being about 112.4 degrees. During the Apollo 11 EVA, the solar azimuth was 88.1 degrees, which allows us to plot the relevant azimuths on a detail from 5936.
