The key to success was to look at LSE-7-6G with west at the top and to look, not at the craters, but at the white ejecta circles drawn around them by the geologists who prepared the map. As can readily be seen in a detail, the ejecta circles create a striking Snowman image.

Close-up of the TV camera, with the Solar Wind Collector (SWC) at the left edge of the picture. Note the loop in the TV cable running off to the left. \r\nPaul Coan, Manned Spaceflight Center Television Subsystem Manager who was responsible for the equipment used on the Apollo spacecraft, writes, \"The same type of cable used to carry video and power between the Apollo 11 TV camera and the LM was used during Apollo 12 to power the first color TV camera to be put on the lunar surface. However, the connector on the color camera did not match the connector on the end of the lunar surface cable that was an integral part of the camera handle. (See a detail from Apollo 11 photo S-69-31575 ). Since the design and qualification of the lunar surface cable was so expensive, it was cost prohibitive to replace the connector on the cable. Cost, schedule, and design constraints also precluded replacing the connector on the color camera. So, we decided to build an adapter that provided the interconnection.\"\r\nIn a detail from 6756, the color-camera camera hangs down from the back, with the yellow-coated adapter immediately blow attached to the silver-tube of the 'handle' from the Apollo 11 configuration.\r\nCoan adds, \"During testing of the color lunar camera connected to the LM on the pad at KSC, we noticed hum bars in the video. We then realized that the finite resistance of the power circuit in the 100 foot lunar camera cable combined with the switching power supply in the camera was sufficient to inject the hum bars in the video. We had to rework the power supply circuits to eliminate the hum bars. There was some quick redesign/rework done to make the camera work.\"\r\n\"Finally, there was a special room provided at KSC for final checkout of the cameras before they were installed in the spacecraft. So that we could test under controlled lighting conditions, the room was painted totally black and provided with heavy window curtains to eliminate light from outside.\"."},{"HtmlTitle":"6757","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/AS12-46-6757.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":207872,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/AS12-46-6757HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":1027072,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"116:24:47 Rightward of 6756, with the TV camera on the left.

Obviously a slight adjustment in the time of the exposure would be needed as 7091 would have been taken after a short bit of movement and 7092 taken even later as Al moved behind the medium sized rim crater above the Surveyor. It would take some work to make a better estimate of the actual times of each exposure, but the current version is clearly off just a bit. It was fun comparing each photo to the new LRO image and seeing very distinctly in some spots a disturbance in the tracks that looked like maybe Al was standing there moving around as he took a set of photos. I need to print out some of the photos and the LRO image and do some triangulation - we can probably get the site of the photo down to an area a couple meters in size or less!\" This photo shows Surveyor III, the Apollo 12 LM Intrepid, and Block Crater. \r\nCoincidently, on 7 September 2011, Andrew Chaikin created a comparison between 7091 and a newly-released LROC image M168353795RE, which shows the landing site in incredible detail.

An idea of the size of the rock can be gained by reference to the gauge on the bottom portion of the number meter. The sample is described in some detail in the Lunar Sample Compendium. \r\nAs indicated in the Apollo 12 Preliminary Science Report, this sample may be the grapefruit-sized rock that Pete mentioned at 132:03:46.

The core tube is mounted on the bottom of a re-inforced Extension Handle so that Al can hit the top of the extension handle and drive the core tube all the way into the ground without having to bend over very far. Note that he is hitting the extension handle with the flat side of the hammer. The pressurized suit makes it difficult to deliver an accurate blow and, by using the flat of the hammer, he increases his chances of making contact. Each of the astronauts has two visors in his Lunar Extravehicular Visor Assembly (LEVA) that covers the bubble helmet. The inner visor reduces the light level reaching the astronaut's eyes while the outer visor, which is electroplated with gold, provides UV protection. We can see the edges of both of Pete's visors. Note, also, the cuff checklist on Pete's left wrist. There is a LM mock-up in the background. We are looking at the side of the spacecraft and, behind Al, we can see the open area from which the MESA (hidden from view) has been deployed."},{"HtmlTitle":"S6955662","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/a12.s69_55662.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":75776,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"During a geology training exercise at Cinder Lake crater field near Sunset Crater, Arizona, Pete Conrad examines the stratigraphy in a crater dug by the USGS with an explosive charge in thick blanket of volcanic ash. 10 October 1969"},{"HtmlTitle":"S6956058","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/a12.s69_56058.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":28672,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Astronaut Pete Conrad sits in the cockpit of a Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (LLTV) during a lunar simulation flight at Ellington Air Force Base.
