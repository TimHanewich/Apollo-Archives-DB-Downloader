On that night, the moon was actually a crescent and, if the date is right, the full moon was necessarily added - for artistic effect - by double exposure or some other technique. (I own a lovely print of the Apollo 17 launch purchased at the National Air and Space Museum - which also includes a full moon...but without clouds and, as well, having the Moon in the north!) Journal Contributor Bill Mellberg has convinced me that KSC-72PC-713 was actually taken two weeks previously on the night of a full moon. He writes \"This photo was shot from the east looking west. In other words, north is on the right side of the image. Which means the picture would have been taken in the wee hours of the morning. Right now, I am looking at the pre-launch Apollo 17 photo (72-H-1454) that I used on the title page of my book (Moon Missions). It also has a full moon but with the clouds having moved. Thus, I believe the Moon is real in KSC-72PC-713 -- only the date (in the caption supplied by NASA) is wrong. It should be 21 November 1972.\" Inaccurate dates are regrettably common in various NASA lists.

Note the bright pattern on the high-gain antenna, which is sunlight reflected off the top of the TV camera.\r\nIn a 2005 discussion with Don McMillan, we were able to explain the shadowing on the antenna. In a detail from 20475, the radial ribs are numbered '1r' clockwise around to '12r' and the outer seams of the mesh from '1s' clockwise to '12s'. Looking at the shadow between ribs 3r and 4r, we see the outer edge of the shadow being cast by seam 3s. This segment of the 3s shadow edge is labeled 3sa. The 3s shadow continues onto with mesh between ribs 4r and 5r. The continuation is labeled 3sb and ends when we getto the shadow of rib 2r. Next clockwise, we see the shadow of seam 2s which falls on the panel between 4r and 5r and continues on the pane between 5r and 65 until we get the the shadow of rib 1r. And so on. Finally, note that, if the antenna wasn't made of mesh and was, instead, made of completely opaque material, panels 4s around to 10s would be copletely shadowed. 12s, 1s, and 2s would be completely illuminated while only portions of 11s and 3s would be in direct sunlight. Consider panel 5s, which is between ribs 4r and 5r. No part of this panel is in full sun. The part outside the 3sb and 2sa shadow edges, the side of the mesh facing away from us is in full sun, but only part of that incident light makes it through by reflecting toward the camera by the mesh wires. On the shadowed part of pan 5s, we are seeing light that made it through panel 2s only 5s and then through 5s to the camera."},{"HtmlTitle":"20476","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-134-20476.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":159744,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-134-20476HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":884736,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"EVA-3 at the LM.

The large boulder in the distance, on the flank of the South Massif beyond the center of Shorty is shown in a detail (3.4 Mb tif) from LROC image M104311715L. The trail it left when it tumbled down the mountain can be seen in the LROC image and, less distinctly, in in a detail from 21194. Like the Station 6 boulder, it appears to have come to a stop when it encountered a much shallower slope low on the mountain. This behaviour is particularly evident in 21194. Identity of the boulder was confirmed by using a portion of Apollo 17 Pan Camera frame AS17-P-2309 to establish the line-of-sight from Station 6 through the center of Shorty and, then, a portion of M104311715L to extend the line-of-sight onward to the base of the Spoth Massif."},{"HtmlTitle":"21195","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-139-21195.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":111616,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-139-21195HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":1290240,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Out-of-focus.

In frame 21205, the ALSEP Central Station and Geophone Rock can be seen near the right edge. Because the distance from the LM to the ALSEP is known (185 meters), we can easily estimate that the distance between fiducial marks on the images corresponds to 0.02 radians or, at the 3.0 kilometers distance of the LM from Station 6, about 60 meters at the spacecraft.

Caes also calls attention to the 'red-brown' color of the boulder face. AFJ Editor David Woods comments, \"The best way to see into these dark regions is with a Photoshop-type program (GIMP is a free alternative). With that, the dark regions can be boosted. I've done this with a gain of 4-times. As you can see, the dark area is not so much red-brown but more magenta (pink-purple, a mix of red and blue). And here comes the problem.\r\n\"There is a very strong chance that the precise colours of those shadowed areas is being misrepresented by errors in the film dyes - and in the scanning process - so, while there may have been a reddish tone to them (perhaps reflection from the Rover's insulation), be wary of taking them at face value. I'm saying this as someone who colour-balances television programmes for a living.\"]\r\n[In addition to the factors Woods mentions, dust on the camera lens can introduce reddish hews in dark areas of the field-of-view, as discussed in relation to the partial panoramas Pete Conrad took at Middle Crescent Crater.]"},{"HtmlTitle":"21496","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-140-21496.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":139264,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-140-21496HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":1024000,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Jack has just retrieved the gnomon and is headed around the south side of Tracy's Rock for the Rover.

took this photo on the orbit before final descent. On the final approach, Gene flew Challenger down over the Sculptured Hills (low, knobby hills in sunlight just right of frame center) and out over the valley floor before landing a little north of the Trident group of craters. The CSM with Ron Evans can be seen in the left distance with the South Massif in the background. Henry is the furthermost of the three largish craters at the foot of the North Massif to the right. The labeled version of this frame picks out a few other features for orientation. Compare this view with the CSM Pan Camera frame and note the distance across the valley from Henry to Bear Mountain and the outcrop hill beyond (in shadow here)."},{"HtmlTitle":"22466","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-147-22466.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":80896,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-147-22466HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":1204224,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Rev 12, CSM, Apollo 17 Landing Site."},{"HtmlTitle":"22467","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-147-22467.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":91136,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-147-22467HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":1207296,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Rev 12, CSM, Apollo 17 Landing Site."},{"HtmlTitle":"22468","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-147-22468.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":14336,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-147-22468HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":216064,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Rev 12, CSM from LM."},{"HtmlTitle":"22469","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-147-22469.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":59392,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17-147-22469HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":1112064,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"115: Pre-EVA-1 LM window pan.

Scan by Kipp Teague. Harald Kucharek raised the possibility that the bright arc visible in the LM window might be Gene Cernan's bubble helmet. Subsequent discussion between Kucharek, Markus Mehring, Brian McInall, Mick Hyde, Marv Hein, Ron Wells, and Eric Jones in late 2000 established the following: (1) the orientation of the LM at this time is such that reflections of the CSM off the flat surface of Gene's window would not be visible to Evans; (2) the orientation of the shadows on the front surface of the LM clearly indicate that, from our perspective, the Sun is overhead and that the bright, rectangular light-source above the arc is the rendezvous window with sunlight shining through it; (3) Cernan and Schmitt wore their bubble helmets - but not their LEVAs - for liftoff and rendezvous. Therefore, the bright arc is likely to be either a sunlit portion of the top of Gene's bubble helmet or, as Hein suggests with reference to AS17-149-22859 (see below), Gene's hair. Mick Hyde has produced a labeled detail. The rendezvous window can also be seen at top center in Jack Schmitt's post-EVA-3 portrait of Gene, AS17-145-22225. Finally, as indicated in the labeled detail and in second detail, there seemed to be a possibility that we were seeing a reflection from the front of Gene's helmet of the lunar horizon partially blocked by the CSM. A view of the CSM during the final phases of rendezvous can be seen in AS17-145-22257 which was taken out Gene's window. However, a higher-resolution detail from 22857 by Kipp Teague makes that interpretation less likely. Journal Contributor Markus Mehring notes that, in this detail, Gene's handcontroller can be seen at the bottom corner of the window."},{"HtmlTitle":"22857/9","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17rb22857-59HR_PV.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":300000,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Red-blue anaglyph by Patrick Vantuyne.
