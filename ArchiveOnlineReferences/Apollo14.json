The prominent foreground crater is Meitner, which has a diameter of 87 km. Journal Contributor Henri Partanen notes that the photos in this sequence are very similar to an Apollo 12 earthrise series that starts with AS12-47-6879. Those photos were also taken at AOS just prior to descent initiation. Because the Apollo 12 and 14 landing sites are both equatorial and are only separated by about 10 degrees of longitude, the orbital planes are similar. A comparison of Celestia images of the Moon as viewed from Earth at the time of the two landings shows that the Moon was in similar libration states. Consequently, the views at AOS should be much the same. See, also, a labeled version ( 2.7 Mb ) by René Cantin.\r\nER*, the online nickname of an anonymous ALSJ contributor and member of Russian-language forums IXBT and Airbase, calls attention to an image of Venus in each of the five frames of the Earthrise sequence, 9224 to 9228.

The LM windows are angled at about 45 degrees to the X-Z plane, with the inner part of the window forward and the outer part aft. A camera aimed forward, parallel to the fore/aft Z axis, will see the objects on the far side of the cabin at about the same fore-aft location. The windows are also tilted with the top forward and the bottom aft, which means that a camera looking fowrward will see objects lower in the cabin. In Apollo 17 image AS17-145-22224, taken after EVA-3, one of the lights at the lower right may be what is seen reflected in AS14-66-9337.As shown in a comparison, the two orange spots also appear at about the same location in 9342.

Of particular interest are the tracks made by the crew and the MET during the traverse to the ALSEP deployment site and during the return to the LM. Apollo 17 astronaut Jack Schmitt speculates that the descent plume sweeps away the fine particles of soil, leaving a surface dominated by small rock fragments that reflect sunlight from the down-Sun direction and make the surface look lighter in color than normal. In places where the surface is disturbed, the normal reflectivity of the surface is restored. Whatever the detailed explanation for this phenomenon, it is related to the fact that, from orbit, the area immediately surrounding a LM looks noticeably lighter in color. The ALSEP Central Station is about 180m from the LM. Note the excursions the crew made around the rimless crater in the foreground and the large depression in the middle distance that they traversed in both directions. Without the visual clues provided by the tracks, the depression is not easy to pick out in this down-Sun photo. Note that the flag is now pointing on an azimuth of about 335 and undoubtedly moved from it prior pointing of about 120 as a result of the cabin depressurization done for the jettison. See a discussion following 131:09:18.\r\nJournal Contributor Yuri Krasilnikov has created a comparison between 9338, a 16-mm frame taken before the pre-launch RCS hot-fire check and a frame following the hot-fire check. Although the orientation of the first two images are different because of camera mounting, the flag orientation relative to, say, the PLSS, is the same. The final frame shows the result of the large flag motion during the hot-fire check. Krasilnikov also calls attention a difference in the orientation of the access flap on the flap shown as it was before the hot-fire check, closeest to the LM in a detail from 9338.\r\nJournal Contributor Jim Scotti notes that we \"can see the impact 'crater' and roll marks made by the PLSS farthest from the LM. It rolled on it's side and you can see a fair bit of detail in the hoses and straps on the righthand side of it.\" Various PLSS imprints are indicated in a detail."},{"HtmlTitle":"9339","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/AS14-66-9339.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":123904,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/AS14-66-9339HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":759808,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Similar to 9338.

This photograph shows that there has been a substantial design change in the SIDE configuration since Apollo 12.\r\nOn that flight, the cable connecting the two instruments was stiff enough that, when the astronauts tried to manipulate the CCIG into its proper orientation, they tipped the SIDE over. Their SIDE sat on four short, splayed legs (see AS12-47-6922) and, for Apollo 14, the support design included longer legs attached near the top of the north and south faces to give more lateral stability. As Ed indicates to Houston at 116:39:59, the new design didn't work much better than the old one. Yet another design was devised for Apollo 15 - with three legs, two short ones at the bottom along one of the long sides and a long leg attached near the top of the opposite face with the SIDE leaning against that long leg.
