The pan was taken starting at about 106:58:27, which was about 0033 UTC on 31 July 1971. At that time, the solar elevation and azimuth were 13.1 and 96.6. The eastern rim of the crater did not cast a shadow at that time, indicating that the inner eastern wall is shallower than 13.1 degrees. Another LROC image, M131623862L, was taken 2156 UTC on 19 June 2010 when the solar elevation was 8.4 degrees. At that time, the eastern half of the crater was nearly filled with shadow, indicating that the inner slope is close to 8.4 degrees. Note that the western rims of some of the small, sharp-rimmed craters within the eastern half of Index are sun lit, another indication that the solar elevation is close to the inner slope."},{"HtmlTitle":"110720M165842369R","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/M165842369.tif","ImageSizeBytes":300,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"This labelled image was downloaded from the LROC site.

Researchers at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) present a version ( 33k ) with a realtively bright area near the known location of the LM outlined in red. The LM landed on the northwest rim of a shallow crater. A comparison ( 152k ) between a detail from Apollo 15 Pan Camera frame 9377 and the Selene/Kaguya image shows that, in the Apollo image, the western portion of the crater interior is bright while in the Selene/Kaguya image, the eastern portion is bright. It seems likely that this difference is due to illumination from the east in the case of the Apollo image and from the west in the case of the Selene/Kaguya image. In both images, the sunlit portion of the crater interior is brighter than other shallow craters in the area, suggesting that the surface layer throughout the crater was brightened by the LM engine exhaust and that the apparent degree of brightening depends on sun angle."},{"HtmlTitle":"Schroter's Valley","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15.seva.html#1065345","ImageSizeBytes":1065345,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15pan1065345.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":233472,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"The frames are AS15-85- 11353 to 11382.

As with the stylized birds on the Apollo 15 patch, the cars are red, white, and dark blue. See a discussion of the car colors and the patch below. From the 11 June 1971 issue of Life Magzine. In a 2005 e-mail, Dave Scott notes \"As I recall, this particular photo of the corvettes was taken out by the launch pad. The corvettes were stylized to essentially show the flag and set a bit of unit pride ...primarily to let the troops know that we were about and paying attention to all they were doing; e.g., at almost any level of the launch complex one could look down and recognize the crew's cars; we went to the pad often for various spacecraft activities as well as to just say hello to the folks putting the Saturn V and its payload together. Awareness, you know, something like the MFAP (Manned Flight Awareness Program, which awarded Snoopy pins to Apollo people who make special contributions. But promoting GM we were not; to own a car at the Cape was much more effective for us and less expensive to NASA than renting a car. Besides, they were fun to drive. I finally sold mine to Ed Fendell who I understand drove it many miles over many years.\" Scan by Ed Hengeveld, combining a scan of the cropped photograph as published and a scan of the distant vegitation and sky from whole-frame copy provided by Al Worden via Al Hallonquist. Hengeveld writes \"However, the overall quality was poorer than the published Life photo, so I PhotoShopped the two together, pasting the background into my Life scan. The seam is a line in the sand behind the astronauts, just in front of the bushes. I did not keep the poorer 'Al Worden' scan."},{"HtmlTitle":"70HC911","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/ap15-70-HC-911.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":147456,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/ap15-70-HC-911HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":1560576,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Dave Scott (left), Al Worden (seated), and Jim Irwin pose with a Rover mock-up.

Scan by J. L. Pickering. For a detailed discussion of this and other mission patches, see Gene's Dorr's excellent Space Mission Patch website and Dick Lattimer's book, All We Did Was Fly to the Moon\". In the latter, Al Worden provides the following: \"The mission patch for Apollo 15 was basically designed by the Italian dress designer, Emilio Pucci. We had as a crew evaluated some 540 different designs for our crew patch. They appeared either too mechanical or to have nothing to do with the flight, so finally, through a mutual friend, we asked Pucci if he would help us with the design. Now, Pucci, as I best recall, was an aeronautical engineer and had a good feeling for flight. With his artistic nature, we felt that he would be very helpful in the patch design. He did send us a design which was basically the same as the patch we eventually used, however the colors were in the normal Pucci blues, purples, and greens. We took his design, changed it from a square to a circular patch, made it red, white and blue, and put a lunar background behind the three stylized birds that were the major Pucci contribution. The symbology is of three stylized birds flying over the lunar surface, each indicating one of us who were on the flight. The lunar surface behind the patch shows the landing site (next to Hadley Rille at the foot of the Appenine Mountains) and directly behind the stylized birds is a crater formation that spells '15' in Roman numerals (XV). You can also see from the stylized birds that they fly in formation with one on top and two closer to the lunar surface, indicating those who actually landed.\" As can be seen in a Life Magazine photograph of the crew in their color-coded Corvettes, Al's car is the same color - white - as his patch symbol."},{"HtmlTitle":"KSC71P340","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/ap15-KSC-71P-340.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":104448,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Apollo 15 Command Module, Service Module, and S-IVB adapter.

My reason for thinking that it was taken at about 164:53:44 is that, at that time, Dave and Jim stop to take a look at a rock and Dave says he's \"getting it\", meaning a picture. 11065 is certainly taken from Dave's side of the Rover.

Note that there appear to be two systems of lineations in Silver Spur. One set consists of what appear to be about ten thick beds which appear to dip down from right to left as seen from the LM. As discussed in the Apollo 15 Preliminary Science Report, this set of lineations may well represent real structure in the mountain.

The footprints Dave made after dismounting are above center on the far side of the Rover tracks. Jim's are on the near side.\r\nJournal Contributor Gary Swearingen calls attention to the mini-landslides triggered by Jim's footsteps as he made his way down from the original Rover parking spot. A detail ( 419k ) focuses on the sequence of footprints and suggests that, initially, Jim put one foot in front of the other, staying on a single level but, eventually, stepped down with his left boot and had his feet on different levels. Swearingen calls particular attention to the mini-landslide associated with the bootprints below the center of the image. The soil in that slides looks like it may have moved as a unit.\r\nIn response to a January 2006 e-mail about the mini-landslides, Apollo soil mechanics investigator David Carrier wrote, \"You have started the New Year off with an interesting question!\"\r\n\"Actually, our soil mechanics team noticed the same bootprints: see Figure 7-12 (AS15-90-12197) on p. 7-12 of the Apollo 15 Preliminary Science Report. They were discussed briefly in a section of the report concerning slope stability, pp. 7-9 to 7-12: 'A preliminary study of the 70- and 500-mm photography available thus far has been made for evidence of slope instability and past slope failures. No indication exist of previous deep-seated slope failures of the type that have been suggested by Lunar Orbiter photos of some areas of the Moon. The near-surface zones of some slopes may be near incipient failure, however. The foreground of figure 7-12 shows failure under footprints as one of the astronauts traversed the slope in the vicinity of station 6A. Detailed analysis of conditions in this area must await more precise determination of the slope angle, which is estimated to be 10 deg to 20 deg.' And the caption of Figure 7-12 reads: 'Incipient slope failure as indicated by slipping out of soil beneath astronauts' feet.'\"\r\n\"As I recall, we did not pursue a more detailed analysis.\"\r\n\"The photo in Figure 7-12 of the report is identified as AS15-90-12197 (and, because it is part of a panoramic sequence) it would be interesting to (use adjacent images) under a stereoscope - which I no longer have! - and get a somewhat distorted stereoscopic view. It would certainly help with estimating the slope angle.\"\r\nJournal Contributor Erik van Meijgaarden has combined 12196 and 12197 in the anaglyph linked below.\r\nCarrier continues, \"My impression is that there is a slight break in the slope near the closest LRV track. That is, the LRV drove along an area that was slightly flatter, and that immediately downslope from the nearest track, there is a slight local steepening. Then, when Jim Irwin walked along the track, straddling it, one foot was on the flatter area - which was pretty soft anyhow, as you can see from the depth of the bootprints - and one foot was on the top - or 'shoulder' - of the slightly steeper slope. So, his downhill bootprints caused the soil to shear and slide outward, rather than simply compress the soil downward. I agree with you that the downhill boot would be somewhat heavier than the uphill. As for the difference between the two closest downhill bootprints, it might be due to: (1) Simply a slight difference in where he placed his boot with respect to the top of the local slope; or (2) That he rotated his boot downhill in the closest bootprint, causing some fines to move over the blocky material, making it look smooth; or a combination of both.\""},{"HtmlTitle":"12196/7","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15rb12196-7HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":2057216,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15rb12196-7.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":188416,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Red-blue anaglyph by Erik van Meijgaarden."},{"HtmlTitle":"12197","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/AS15-90-12197.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":154624,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/AS15-90-12197HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":879616,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"145:09:18 Rightward of 12196, showing the footprints Jim left moving down to the pan location."},{"HtmlTitle":"12198","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/AS15-90-12198.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":140288,"ImageBytes":null},{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/AS15-90-12198HR.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":887808,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"145:09:18 Rightward of 12197 showing the far (west) end of the Rover tracks.
