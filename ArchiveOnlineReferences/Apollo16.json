The tripod was deployed 15 meters away from the MET or Rover and, as the tripod was carried out to the deployment site, the ribbon cable unwound off both sides of the centrally-mounted cable reel. Once the astronaut deployed the tripod, he went back to the MET/Rover and initiated a measurement. After waiting a pre-determined amount of time for transients to damp out, he read the X, Y, and Z values on each of the two gain settings. He then went out to the tripod and changed the orientation of the sensor head at the top of the tripod, returned to the MET/Rover and made another measurement. Once the measurement series was finished, he retrieved the tripod, brought it back to the MET/Rover and rewound the cable using the handle visible on the right-hand side of the reel.

In that photo, the crater is about 2 fiducials up and 0.4 to the right. According to Figure 6-54 in the Apollo 16 Preliminary Science Report, Crown Crater, the largest crater on the western portion of the mountain, is 0.5 to 0.8 fiducials left and 1.7 fiducials up from center. Our line of sight is more or less parallel to the plan of the rim and, therefore, the crater is difficult to pick out in the Station 8 photo and in the LM photos.
