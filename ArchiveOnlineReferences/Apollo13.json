In an April 2005 e-mail, Stan Lebar, the Westinghouse Lunar Camera Program Manager, notes that the camera on the training MESA in this series of photographs is a black&white camera. The flight MESA had a color TV camera. \"There weren't very many flight units available for this type of use and I suspect that if they had a mockup, they would have used it in lieu of a flight model. Since the TV SEC (Secondary Electron Conduction) vidicon as used in Apollo 12 was replaced with a newly developed SIT (Silicon Intensifier Tube) on Apollo 14 to minimize the possibility of having a repeat of the Apollo 12 fiasco. We had only one CM and LM TV cameras upgraded with a SIT by then and I doubt if they would have chanced using either one of these flight models for this type of test.\"To the right of the upper rock box, we see a pair of tongs and an extension handle.

Lithium hydroxide is used to scrub CO2 from the spacecraft's atmosphere. Since there was a limited amount of lithium hydroxide in the LM, this arrangement was rigged up to utilize the canisters from the CM. The \"mail box\" was designed and tested on the ground at the Manned Spacecraft Center before it was suggested to the Apollo 13 crewmen.

It shows the post-launch Rev 1 and 2 ground tracks for launches at the beginning and end of the launch window. An on-time launch would have left the Cape on an azimuth of 72 degrees while a launch at the end of the window would have left on an azimuth of 96 degrees. Apollo 13 launched on time. Mike marked the splashdown location soon after the crew was safely recovered."},{"HtmlTitle":"a13splash","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a13/a13lovellglvs.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":38912,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"This Ulrich Lotzmann photo shows the gloves on display at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago."},{"HtmlTitle":"a13LEVA","AttachedImages":[{"LinkToImage":"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a13/a13LovellVisor.jpg","ImageSizeBytes":1300000,"ImageBytes":null}],"Description":"Jim Lovell's flown LEVA, photographed at the Adler Planetarium by Arthur de Wolf This version of the LEVA was first flown on Apollo 13 and included a central eyeshade with a raisable flap.
